									GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
									Version 3, 29 June 2007
				
									Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
									Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
									of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
				
				
									This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
									the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
									License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
				
									0. Additional Definitions.
				
									As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
									General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
									General Public License.
				
									"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
									other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
				
									An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
									by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
									Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
									of using an interface provided by the Library.
				
									A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
									Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
									with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
									Version".
				
									The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
									Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
									for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
									based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
				
									The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
									object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
									and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
									Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
				
									1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
				
									You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
									without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
				
									2. Conveying Modified Versions.
				
									If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
									facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
									that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
									facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
									version:
				
									a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
									ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
									function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
									whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
				
									b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
									this License applicable to that copy.
				
									3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
				
									The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
									a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
									code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
									material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
									layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
									(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
				
									a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
									Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
									covered by this License.
				
									b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
									document.
				
									4. Combined Works.
				
									You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
									taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
									portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
									engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
									the following:
				
									a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
									the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
									covered by this License.
				
									b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
									document.
				
									c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
									execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
									these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
									copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
				
									d) Do one of the following:
				
									0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
									License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
									suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
									recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
									the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
									manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
									Corresponding Source.
				
									1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
									Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
									a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
									system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
									of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
									Version.
				
									e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
									be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
									GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
									necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
									Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
									Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
									you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
									the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
									Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
									Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
									for conveying Corresponding Source.)
				
									5. Combined Libraries.
				
									You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
									Library side by side in a single library together with other library
									facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
									License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
									choice, if you do both of the following:
				
									a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
									on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
									conveyed under the terms of this License.
				
									b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
									is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
									accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
				
									6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
				
									The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
									of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
									versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
									differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
				
									Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
									Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
									of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
									applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
									conditions either of that published version or of any later version
									published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
									received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
									General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
									General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
				
									If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
									whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
									apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
									permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
									Library.

									GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
									Version 2, June 1991
			
									Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
									59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
									Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
									of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
			
									Preamble
			
									The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
									freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
									License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
									software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
									General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
									Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
									using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
									the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
									your programs, too.
			
									When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
									price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
									have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
									this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
									if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
									in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
			
									To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
									anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
									These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
									distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
			
									For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
									gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
									you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
									source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
									rights.
			
									We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
									(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
									distribute and/or modify the software.
			
									Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
									that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
									software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
									want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
									that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
									authors' reputations.
			
									Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
									patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
									program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
									program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
									patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
			
									The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
									modification follow.
			
									GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
									TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
			
									0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
									a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
									under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
									refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
									means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
									that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
									either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
									language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
									the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
			
									Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
									covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
									running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
									is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
									Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
									Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
			
									1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
									source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
									conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
									copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
									notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
									and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
									along with the Program.
			
									You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
									you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
			
									2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
									of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
									distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
									above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
			
									a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
									stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
			
									b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
									whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
									part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
									parties under the terms of this License.
			
									c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
									when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
									interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
									announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
									notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
									a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
									these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
									License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
									does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
									the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
			
									These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
									identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
									and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
									themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
									sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
									distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
									on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
									this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
									entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
			
									Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
									your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
									exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
									collective works based on the Program.
			
									In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
									with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
									a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
									the scope of this License.
			
									3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
									under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
									Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
			
									a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
									source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
									1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
			
									b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
									years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
									cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
									machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
									distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
									customarily used for software interchange; or,
			
									c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
									to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
									allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
									received the program in object code or executable form with such
									an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
			
									The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
									making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
									code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
									associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
									control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
									special exception, the source code distributed need not include
									anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
									form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
									operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
									itself accompanies the executable.
			
									If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
									access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
									access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
									distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
									compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
			
									4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
									except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
									otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
									void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
									However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
									this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
									parties remain in full compliance.
			
									5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
									signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
									distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
									prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
									modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
									Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
									all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
									the Program or works based on it.
			
									6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
									Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
									original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
									these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
									restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
									You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
									this License.
			
									7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
									infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
									conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
									otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
									excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
									distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
									License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
									may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
									license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
									all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
									the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
									refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
			
									If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
									any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
									apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
									circumstances.
			
									It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
									patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
									such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
									integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
									implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
									generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
									through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
									system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
									to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
									impose that choice.
			
									This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
									be a consequence of the rest of this License.
			
									8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
									certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
									original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
									may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
									those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
									countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
									the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
			
									9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
									of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
									be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
									address new problems or concerns.
			
									Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
									specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
									later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
									either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
									Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
									this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
									Foundation.
			
									10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
									programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
									to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
									Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
									make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
									of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
									of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
			
									NO WARRANTY
			
									11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
									FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
									OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
									PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
									OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
									MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
									TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
									PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
									REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
			
									12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
									WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
									REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
									INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
									OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
									TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
									YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
									PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
									POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
			
									END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
			
									How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
			
									If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
									possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
									free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
			
									To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
									to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
									convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
									the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
			
									<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
										Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
			
											This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
											it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
											the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
											(at your option) any later version.
			
											This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
											but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
											MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
											GNU General Public License for more details.
			
											You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
											along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
											Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
			
			
											Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
			
											If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
											when it starts in an interactive mode:
			
											Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
											Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
											This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
											under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
			
											The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
											parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
											be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
											mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
			
											You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
											school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
											necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
			
											Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
											`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

												This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
												proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
												consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
												library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
												Public License instead of this License.
